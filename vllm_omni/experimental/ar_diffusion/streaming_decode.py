"""Session-owned streaming VAE decode for realtime AR-Diffusion.

A causal video decoder already decodes one latent frame at a time, carrying a
bounded temporal cache between frames. What it does not do today is carry that
cache *between requests*: every decode call clears it, so a chunk can only be
decoded as part of a whole clip.

This module moves the cache from the decoder module to the session, which is
the entire difference between "decode a clip" and "stream a session":

* the cache becomes :class:`StreamingDecodeState`, threaded in and out by the
  caller, so two concurrent sessions cannot overwrite each other's temporal
  context -- a failure that produces a plausible but wrong video while every
  timing metric stays green;
* ``first_chunk`` becomes a property of the session's first frame rather than
  of the call, which is what makes chunk ``N + 1`` continue chunk ``N``.

Resident state is bounded by construction: each causal convolution retains at
most ``CACHE_T`` temporal slices, so the cache is a function of resolution and
never of session length. It is not free -- see :meth:`StreamingDecodeState.nbytes`,
which is the quantity session admission has to account for.

Only ``torch`` is imported here so the contract can be exercised without a
device, a checkpoint, or the distributed VAE stack.
