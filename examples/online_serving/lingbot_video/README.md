# LingBot-Video

LingBot-Video uses one `LingBotVideoPipeline` for text-to-image (T2I),
text-to-video (T2V), and text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation. Both the dense
and MoE checkpoints use the same request format.

## Start the server

```bash
MODEL=robbyant/lingbot-video-dense-1.3b bash run_server.sh
```

The MoE checkpoint can be selected with
`MODEL=robbyant/lingbot-video-moe-30b-a3b`. It requires substantially more GPU
memory than the dense checkpoint.

## Text to image

The image endpoint selects T2I mode and always generates one frame:

```bash
bash run_curl_text_to_image.sh
```

The script sends a `320x192`, two-step smoke request and writes
`lingbot_t2i.png`.

## Text or text-image to video

Pass a first-frame image to select TI2V mode:

```bash
INPUT_IMAGE=/path/to/input.png bash run_curl_text_image_to_video.sh
```

Remove the `input_reference` form field from the create request to select T2V.
The example uses the lightweight `320x192`, 9-frame, two-step configuration.

LingBot video frame counts must be `1` or `4n+1`. An explicit `num_frames`
takes precedence over `seconds`. When only `seconds` is supplied, the server
converts `seconds * fps` upward to the next valid `4n+1` frame count.

Official `resolution`/`ratio` presets can be sent through `extra_params`, for
example `{"resolution":"720p","ratio":"16:9"}`. The `2k` and `4k` entries
only define output dimensions; whether they run successfully depends on the
checkpoint, GPU memory, and memory optimizations available in the deployment.

LingBot TI2V accepts exactly one image reference. Image editing, video
references, audio references, batching, and Refiner execution are not supported
by this pipeline mode.
