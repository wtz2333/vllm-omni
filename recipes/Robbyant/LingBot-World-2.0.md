# LingBot-World 2.0

> Offline and experimental realtime interactive world generation

## Summary

- Vendor: Robbyant
- Model: `robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast-diffusers`
- Task: image-conditioned interactive world generation
- Modes: offline trajectory replay, stepwise one-request streaming, and in-process realtime AR-Diffusion ticks (deprecated)
- Hardware validated: NVIDIA H200 and B200
- Maintainer: Community

The checkpoint is separately licensed under CC BY-NC-SA and restricted to
non-commercial use. The vLLM-Omni integration code remains Apache-2.0.

## Which path to use

There are three ways to drive this model, each documented in its own section
below.

- **Realtime stepwise** — see [Streaming video serving](#streaming-video-serving).
  The suggested path: one `WS /v1/realtime/video` session produces the whole
  rollout, one video chunk per AR block. Mid-session camera control uses
  structural SE3 `session.interaction` payloads; optional
  `camera_action_script` remains for request-scoped WASD scripts.
- **Realtime tick** *(deprecated)* — see
  [Realtime in-process generation](#realtime-in-process-generation-deprecated).
  Older one-block-per-`generate()` control plane with JSONL WASD frames; will be removed in the future.
- **Offline** — see [Offline generation](#offline-generation). Replays a fixed
  pose/intrinsics trajectory in one request and writes an MP4. Use it when the
  camera path is known up front and streaming is not needed.

## Offline generation

The offline path consumes one source image and an action directory containing
`poses.npy` with shape `[frames, 4, 4]` and `intrinsics.npy` with shape
`[frames, 4]`.

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/diffusion/lingbot_world_v2.py \
  --prompt "The camera moves slowly forward through the scene." \
  --image /path/to/first_frame.png \
  --action-dir /path/to/actions/forward \
  --num-frames 81 \
  --output lingbot_world_v2.mp4
```

The current causal-fast checkpoint uses four DMD sampling steps. Raw frame
counts must be `9 + 12k` for a non-negative integer `k`; for example, 129 frames
produce eleven AR blocks. Both camera files must contain the same number of
source frames, at least as many as requested and at most 4096. The runtime
consumes only the prefix needed by the request. Longer rollouts also require
sufficient device memory.

## Realtime in-process generation (deprecated)

Prefer [Streaming video serving](#streaming-video-serving) for mid-session
camera control. This tick example still works and emits no runtime warning;
removal is tracked as B4 of the LingBot World 2.0 roadmap
([#6672](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/6672)).

The realtime example keeps AR-Diffusion KV and model-owned state across
requests. Each JSONL line describes the prompt and/or three latent-frame camera
actions applied at the next chunk boundary:

```json
{"event_id":1,"prompt":"A road through a forest","frames":[["j"],[],[]]}
{"event_id":2,"frames":[["w"],["w"],["w"]]}
{"event_id":3,"prompt":"The road enters a snowy valley","frames":[[],[],[]]}
```

Run:

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/diffusion/lingbot_world_v2_realtime.py \
  --image /path/to/first_frame.png \
  --events /path/to/events.jsonl \
  --output-dir /tmp/lingbot-realtime \
  --gpu-memory-fraction 0.6
```

The example writes one latent tensor and one metadata JSON file per chunk. It
exercises the same `ARDiffusionSessionManager -> ARDiffusionOmniTickConsumer
-> AsyncOmni -> ARDiffusionEngine` path used by a future HTTP or WebSocket
transport.

Realtime serving now goes through the generic `WS /v1/realtime/video`
transport, which exposes no LingBot-specific event fields; the tick loop above
stays available only for the older control plane.

## Streaming video serving

The stepwise path keeps AR-Diffusion paged KV but issues **one** request for
the whole rollout: `prepare_encode` runs once, then every AR block is four DMD
steps followed by one streamed chunk. Identity metadata uses
`session_id = request_id` with contiguous `chunk_index` values from zero.
Camera motion can be request-scoped (`camera_action_script` / `action_path`) or
updated mid-session via `session.interaction`.

Serve it with the AR-Diffusion deploy config, which selects the AR-Diffusion
engine and enables streamed step execution:

```bash
vllm serve robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast-diffusers \
  --omni \
  --deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/lingbot_world_v2_stepwise.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

`--deploy-config` is required: the `lingbot_world` pipeline deliberately
registers no default deploy config, so offline replay and the tick example
keep their request-mode topology when no deploy config is given, and the
stepwise serving topology is only ever an explicit choice.

Clients then use the generic WebSocket protocol documented in
[`docs/serving/streaming_video_output_api.md`](../../docs/serving/streaming_video_output_api.md):
`session.start` begins one rollout and each AR block arrives as a binary video
chunk. The model is image-conditioned, so the first frame is required
at `image_reference` as an `http(s)` or `data:` URL; an optional request-scoped
pre-scripted list of WASD actions can be provided in `extra_params`:

```json
{"type": "session.start", "model": "robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast-diffusers",
 "prompt": "The camera moves slowly forward through the scene.",
 "image_reference": {"image_url": "data:image/png;base64,<first frame>"},
 "width": 832, "height": 480, "num_frames": 33,
 "extra_params": {"flow_shift": 5.0,
                  "camera_action_script": [[["w"], ["w"], ["w"]], [["a"], [], []], [[], [], []]]}}
```

`camera_action_script` must hold exactly one action list per generated
chunk, and a request generates `((num_frames - 1) // 4 + 1) // 3` chunks:
three for `num_frames: 33`, seven for `num_frames: 81`.

Mid-session camera control uses structural SE3 on `session.interaction`
(Unity frame: `+X` right, `+Y` up, `+Z` forward). WASD key tokens belong in
clients and are required to be converted before submitting to the service:

```json
{"type": "session.interaction",
 "interaction": {
   "event_id": "forward-1",
   "event": {
     "multi_modal_data": {
       "camera": {
         "mode": "velocity",
         "data": {"translation": [0.0, 0.0, 0.05], "rotation": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]}
       }
     }
   }
 }}
```

The bundled client helps translate the protocol, converting `--camera-updates` keystrokes to corresponding SE3 matrices:

```bash
python examples/online_serving/streaming_video_generation/streaming_video_client.py \
  --model robbyant/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast-diffusers \
  --prompt "The camera moves slowly forward through the scene." \
  --image-reference /path/to/first_frame.png \
  --width 832 --height 480 --num-frames 33 --fps 16 --seed 42 \
  --camera-updates '[{"at": 1.0, "actions": ["w"]}, {"at": 3.0, "actions": ["a"]}]' \
  --output lingbot_world_v2_stream.mp4
```

A served request may instead point at a pose/intrinsics trajectory with
`extra_params.action_path`, which is resolved inside the trusted root set by
`model_config.lingbot_action_root` or `VLLM_OMNI_LINGBOT_ACTION_ROOT`; a server
started without that root configured accepts only `camera_action_script` or
mid-session camera interaction.

Requested `width`/`height` must match `ar_diffusion_width`/`ar_diffusion_height`
in the deploy config, because the AR cache geometry is fixed at load time.
Blocks are decoded independently, so seams between chunks are possible; a
session-owned streaming decoder is tracked separately.

The deprecated tick example remains available for the older
one-block-per-`generate()` control plane.

## Realtime identity and controls

- `session_id` identifies the persistent world and its worker-owned state.
- `event_id` identifies a prompt/control update and remains monotonic across reset.
- `chunk_index` is contiguous from zero and restarts from zero after reset.
- `request_id` correlates one chunk snapshot with its output metadata.
- AsyncOmni uses a separate UUID-suffixed internal engine routing ID.

The generic runtime transports controls as opaque snapshots. LingBot's adapter
accepts:

- `lingbot.camera_actions.v1` for per-latent-frame key states such as `w`, `a`,
  `s`, `d`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`;
- `lingbot.camera_trajectory.v1` for explicit pose/intrinsics trajectories.

## Validation

Real-checkpoint validation uses 480x832 output, four DMD steps, and seed 42.
The exercised matrix includes:

- TP=1 and TP=2 execution;
- two interleaved resident sessions;
- action input and prompt switching;
- seven contiguous chunks crossing the sink plus recent rolling window;
- direct versus paged replay;
- CUDA Graph execution;
- reset, close, failure cleanup, and exact metadata matching; and
- nine-frame VAE decode.

Official `generate.py` accuracy and performance numbers, together with
generation artifacts, are recorded in the PR validation section for the exact
tested commit.

## Current limitations

- Only the 14B causal-fast checkpoint is supported.
- The tick control plane is internal; the public transport is the stepwise
  `WS /v1/realtime/video` path with structural SE3 mid-session camera
  interaction (WASD remains a client-side or `camera_action_script` convenience).
- Stepwise serving requires an explicit
  `--deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/lingbot_world_v2_stepwise.yaml`; there is
  no default deploy config for this model.
- AR-Diffusion stages currently require one replica because session-affine
  routing across replicas is not implemented.
- Tick mode generates one AR block per request. Stepwise mode generates many
  AR blocks in one request. `max_num_seqs` must be one in both cases.
- Stateful streaming VAE decode is not implemented; the realtime example emits
  latent chunks.
- SP/USP, pipeline/CFG parallelism, HSDP, VAE parallelism, quantization,
  Cache-DiT, TeaCache, causal-pretrain, and the 1.3B checkpoint are not claimed.
- No AMD GPU, Ascend NPU, or Intel GPU support is claimed.
